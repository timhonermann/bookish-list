Bookish List uses C4 modeling to document the architecture of the bookish list.
C4 is a modeling and documentation language developed to express architecture in a powerful way.
The C4 model consists of Context, Container, Component and Code level diagrams.
In the C4 Model, each level represents a different level of abstraction, and it is possible to zoom from the highest abstraction to more detailed one.

*Note:* _You don't need to use all 4 levels of diagram; only those that add value._ +
