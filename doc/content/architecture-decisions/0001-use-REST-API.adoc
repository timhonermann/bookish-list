== Context and Problem Statement

Backend and Frontend need to be able to communicate with each other. In this case the Frontend needs to retrieve the data from the Backend.

== Considered Options

* REST
* GraphQL
* WebSockets

== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "REST", because it enables a backend driven API which can be called from multiple frontends (e.g Mobile Apps).
Bi-Directional communication is not needed and GraphQL enables a frontend driven API by querying the backend.
REST is the most flexible option and is the most widely used.

=== Positive Consequences

* Standardized API
* Architectural conventions
* Easy to use
* Easy to maintain
* Big community

=== Negative Consequences

* Data aggregation happens in the frontend

== Pros and Cons of the Options

=== REST

* Good, because backend driven API
* Good, because architectural conventions
* Bad, because data aggregation needs separate layer

=== GraphQL

* Good, because enables frontend side querying
* Good, because gets rid of a data aggregation layer
* Bad, because frontend driven

=== WebSockets

* Good, because enables bi directional communication
* Good, because only one endpoint is needed
* Bad, because Events need to be maintained and stored in a structured way in the backend and frontend
