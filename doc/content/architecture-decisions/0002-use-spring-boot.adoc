== Context and Problem Statement

Backend frameworks are server-side programming language libraries that help build the backend structure of an application or service.

== Considered Options

* Spring Boot
* Micronaut

== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Spring Boot", because it is the most mature and popular framework.

== Pros and Cons of the Options

=== Spring Boot

* Good, because it is a framework with a big ecosystem
* Good, because it has the biggest community of all Java-Frameworks
* Good, because it is very easy to sue and understand
* Bad, because it is not as lightweight as other frameworks

=== Micronaut

* Good, because it is lightweight
* Bad, because it's community is not very big
* Bad, because it is limited in its functionality compared to other frameworks
