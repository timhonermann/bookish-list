== Context and Problem Statement

For the application to be accessible to its users, it must be deployed to a server.

== Considered Options

* Self Hosted
* Heroku
* DigitalOcean

== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Heroku", because it is easy to use and its free plan offers enough for this application to run in its current size.

== Pros and Cons of the Options

=== Self Hosted

* Good, because it enables full control over the infrastructure
* Bad, because it needs a lot of resources to configure and run the infrastructure
* Bad, because the infrastructure needs to be paid as well

=== Heroku

* Good, because it is free
* Good, because it is easy to integrate in the CI/CD pipeline
* Good, because it offers a free plan for PostgreSQL database
* Bad, because database space is very limited, needs reconsidering if the application size grows

=== DigitalOcean

* Good, because it is easy to integrate in CI/CD pipeline
* Bad, because it has no free plan for hosting the application including the database
