The Bookish List is a web application that allows users to look up books.
These books can be added to a personal list.
Books in the list can be marked with a status (e.g. read, TBR, DNF etc.).
Books can also be given a review and get enhanced with comments.
The goal of Bookish List is to keep a clear overview on what books you've read or want to read no matter whether they are in a physical or digital form.

Stakeholder for this project is my girlfriend Maya.
She is an absolute book nerd and came up with this project idea, so I can practice for my bachelor's thesis.
