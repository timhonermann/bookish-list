== Context and Problem Statement

The backend for the bookish list must be built with a fitting architecture to fulfill its non-functional requirements.

== Considered Options

* Monolith
* Modular Monolith
* Microservices

== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Modular Monolith", because it is a structured approach following Domain-Driven-Design without introducing the complexity of microservices.
With a modular monolith breaking out single services into a microservice is fairly easy, but it allows to explore the complexity of a system without having to make decisions too early with too little information.

=== Positive Consequences

* DDD
* High cohesion, low coupling
* Allows to explore the complexity of a system
* Breaking out services into microservices is easy

=== Negative Consequences

* Monolithic applications need strict policies to prevent coupling
* If one module crashes, the whole system crashes

== Pros and Cons of the Options

=== Monolith

* Good, because it is easy to set up
* Bad, because it is hard to maintain
* Bad, because it evolves into chaos quickly
* Bad, because it is a single point of failure
* Bad, because it is hard to decouple later

=== Modular Monolith

* Good, because it is based on Domain-Driven-Design
* Good, because it increases cohesion and lowers coupling
* Good, because the complexity of the system can be explored
* Good, because breaking out a single service into a microservice when needed is fairly easy
* Bad, because it needs to be deployed as one
* Bad, because if one service crashes, the whole system crashes

=== Microservices

* Good, because it enables hard modularity
* Good, because it increases cohesion and lowers coupling
* Good, because services are independent of each other and can be deployed independently
* Good, because it allows a resilient design of the system
* Bad, because it introduces complexity into the system
* Bad, because it requires a lot of infrastructure expense and know how
* Bad, because it requires more resources than a monolith
