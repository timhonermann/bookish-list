Bookish List uses Architecture Decision Records to document architecture decisions of the bookish list software system.

An architecture decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

By logging decisions chronologically, you will be able to:

* Understand past technical decisions and their context
* Take new decisions with confidence
* Always have an up-to-date technical documentation and training material available
* Onboard new developers quicker
* Set up a collaborative decision process thanks to pull requests
