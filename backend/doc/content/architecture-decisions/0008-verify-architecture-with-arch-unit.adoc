== Context and Problem Statement

Architectural dependencies need to be verified for a maintainable codebase.

== Considered Options

* Pull Request Reviews
* ArchUnit

== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "ArchUnit", because it allows automated rule testing within a CI/CD pipeline.

=== Positive Consequences

* Rules can be defined within code base
* Automated tests as part of a CI/CD pipeline
* Low costs because it is automated

== Pros and Cons of the Options

=== Pull Request Reviews

* Bad, because it is easy to overlook an architectural violation
* Bad, because it costs a lot of time to also check code for architectural violations
* Bad, because it is prone to human error

=== ArchUnit

* Good, because it is automated
* Good, because it can be integrated into an existing CI/CD pipeline
* Good, because architectural rule changes can be reviews as PR
* Good, because it is way more time efficient than manual testing
* Good, because it is a standardized process and will always run and check code the same way
